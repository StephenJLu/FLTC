      <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) You have the legal right to use any credit or debit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Order; and that (ii) the information You supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>
      <p>By submitting such information, You grant us the right to provide the information to payment processing third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Your Order.</p>
      <h2>Order Cancellation</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order at any time for certain reasons including but not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Goods availability</li>
        <li>Errors in the description or prices for Goods</li>
        <li>Errors in Your Order</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We reserve the right to refuse or cancel Your Order if fraud or an unauthorized or illegal transaction is suspected.</p>
      <h3>Your Order Cancellation Rights</h3>
      <p>Any Goods you purchase can only be returned in accordance with these Terms and Conditions and Our Returns Policy.</p>
      <p>Our Returns Policy forms a part of these Terms and Conditions. Please read our Returns Policy to learn more about your right to cancel Your Order.</p>
      <p>Your right to cancel an Order only applies to Goods that are returned in the same condition as You received them. You should also include all of the products instructions, documents and wrappings. Goods that are damaged or not in the same condition as You received them or which are worn simply beyond opening the original packaging will not be refunded. You should therefore take reasonable care of the purchased Goods while they are in Your possession.</p>
      <p>We will reimburse You no later than 14 days from the day on which We receive the returned Goods. We will use the same means of payment as You used for the Order, and You will not incur any fees for such reimbursement.</p>
      <p>You will not have any right to cancel an Order for the supply of any of the following Goods:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The supply of Goods made to Your specifications or clearly personalized.</li>
        <li>The supply of Goods which according to their nature are not suitable to be returned, deteriorate rapidly or where the date of expiry is over.</li>
        <li>The supply of Goods which are not suitable for return due to health protection or hygiene reasons and were unsealed after delivery.</li>
        <li>The supply of Goods which are, after delivery, according to their nature, inseparably mixed with other items.</li>
        <li>The supply of digital content which is not supplied on a tangible medium if the performance has begun with Your prior express consent and You have acknowledged Your loss of cancellation right.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies</h2>
      <p>We are constantly updating Our offerings of Goods on the Service. The Goods available on Our Service may be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable, and We may experience delays in updating information regarding our Goods on the Service and in Our advertising on other websites.</p>
      <p>We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services. We reserve the right to change or update information and to correct errors, inaccuracies, or omissions at any time without prior notice.</p>
      <h2>Prices Policy</h2>
      <p>The Company reserves the right to revise its prices at any time prior to accepting an Order.</p>
      <p>The prices quoted may be revised by the Company subsequent to accepting an Order in the event of any occurrence affecting delivery caused by government action, variation in customs duties, increased shipping charges, higher foreign exchange costs and any other matter beyond the control of the Company. In that event, You will have the right to cancel Your Order.</p>
      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>All Goods purchased are subject to a one-time payment. Payment can be made through various payment methods we have available, such as Visa, MasterCard, Affinity Card, American Express cards or online payment methods (PayPal, for example).</p>
      <p>Payment cards (credit cards or debit cards) are subject to validation checks and authorization by Your card issuer. If we do not receive the required authorization, We will not be liable for any delay or non-delivery of Your Order.</p>
      <h1>Memberships</h1>
      <h2>Membership period</h2>
      <p>The Service or some parts of the Service are available only with a paid Membership. You will be billed in advance on a monthly or annual basis.</p>
      <p>At the end of each period, Your Membership will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless You cancel it or the Company cancels it.</p>
      <h2>Membership cancellations</h2>
      <p>You may cancel Your Membership renewal either through Your Account settings page or by contacting the Company.
        You will not receive a refund for the fees You already paid for Your current Membership period and You will be able to access the Service until the end of Your current Membership period.</p>
      <h2>Billing</h2>
      <p>You shall provide the Company with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information.</p>
      <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>
      <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
      <p>The Company, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Membership fees. Any Membership fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Membership period.</p>
      <p>The Company will provide You with reasonable prior notice of any change in Membership fees to give You an opportunity to terminate Your Membership before such change becomes effective.</p>
      <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Membership fee change comes into effect constitutes Your agreement to pay the modified Membership fee amount.</p>
      <h2>Refunds</h2>
      <p>Except when required by law, paid Membership fees are non-refundable.</p>
      <p>Certain refund requests for Membership fees may be considered by the Company on a case-by-case basis and granted at the sole discretion of the Company.</p>
      <h1>User Accounts</h1>

      <p>You agree not to disclose Your password to any third party. You must notify Us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of Your account.</p>
      <p>You may not use as a username the name of another person or entity or that is not lawfully available for use, a name or trademark that is subject to any rights of another person or entity other than You without appropriate authorization, or a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene.</p>

      <p>We may terminate or suspend Your Account immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if You breach these Terms and Conditions.</p>
      <p>Upon termination, Your right to use the Service will cease immediately. If You wish to terminate Your Account, You may simply discontinue using the Service.</p>
      <h1>Limitation of Liability</h1>
      <p>Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100 USD if You haven't purchased anything through the Service.</p>
      <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
      <p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states, each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.</p>
